1. Location and NPCs
  Could go either way, but figure out which option is more streamlined...
  Will have to change how methods work depending on which one.
  So the question is, (and maybe we don't need to go with just one or the other)  
    a. List the location within the NPC and Player instances?
    b. List the NPC/Player in the Location instance?
  Right now I have both ways implemented. 
     - "cur_npcs" under parent class Location
     and
     - "location" under parent class NPC    
  
2. Create Classes/Subclasses for mechanics and items.
  Also change the methods that reference these to accurately print them. 
  Right now only constructed strings of mechanics/items are printed
  for instance
      def inventory(self):
        print(self.backpack)  <---- Line 95
  is referencing the empty list in
        THEPLAYER = Player("Insert_Player_Name_lols", 25, "male-ish", 12, 16, 15, 15, 13, 15, town_square, [])   <----- Line 155
  But when the backpack is full of instances of the theoretical Items class, the method will have to reflect that.
  
  
  3. Player/NPC phase 
    I remember you talking about switching between phases in your dungeon game. I'm not sure how to do that. 
    If it was up to me, I would just create some kind of method chain in the player while loop and NPC parent class that 
    controls the NPCs, but yeaaah I'm thinking there's a way better way to do this, like what you were doing in your dungeon game.
